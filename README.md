# fly-log-shipper

see [README](https://github.com/superfly/fly-log-shipper) in the repository this was forked from for details of how to use and configure it.

This fork adds some custom transformations to logs coming out of our fly apps to ensure all output logs are in a structured JSON format.

See our modified [vector.toml](https://github.com/cepro/fly-log-shipper/blob/main/vector-configs/vector.toml) for details.
